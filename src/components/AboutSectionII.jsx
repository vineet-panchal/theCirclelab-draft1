          Computer Science is perpetually evolving, constantly pushing the 
          boundaries of innovation. Yet, while its innovations continually 
          reshape our future, there's an emerging understanding that the way 
          we learn about technology and its intent matters. Led by 
          <span className="ASII-title-highlights"> Dr. Preeti Raman</span>, 
          the Computational Innovations and Research for Care-centered Learning 
          and Education (CIRCLE) lab, in the Department of Computer Science at 
          the Toronto Metropolitan University, stands at the forefront of this pedagogical revolution.
